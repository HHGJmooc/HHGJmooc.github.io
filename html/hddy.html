                    By twelve o’clock next day, Harry’s trunk was packed with his school things, and all his most prized possessions – the
                    Invisibility Cloak he had inherited from his father, the broomstick he had got from Sirius, the enchanted map of
                    Hogwarts he had been given by Fred and George Weasley last year. He had emptied his hiding place under the loose
                    floorboard of all food, double-checked every nook and cranny of his bedroom for forgotten spellbooks or quills, and
                    taken down the chart on the wall counting the days down to September the first, on which he liked to cross off the days
                    remaining until his return to Hogwarts.
                    
                    The atmosphere inside number four Privet Drive was extremely tense. The imminent arrival at their house of an assortment
                    of wizards was making the Dursleys uptight and irritable. Uncle Vernon had looked downright alarmed when Harry informed
                    him that the Weasleys would be arriving at five o’clock the very next day.
                    
                    ‘I hope you told them to dress properly, these people,’ he snarled at once. ‘I’ve seen the sort of stuff your lot wear.
                    They’d better have the decency to put on normal clothes, that’s all.’
